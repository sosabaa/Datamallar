# AP4 Use Case Documentation - Light Fixture Selection

## Use case description
The brief, with focus on space function, is developed by the client, and documented in a machine-readable format using standardized properties defined in a data dictionary. These should include both lighting technical requirements and guidelines based on references to standards and planning guides. In collaboration with the architect, the desired room experience is also described. In this functional test an office space is used as a case study.
These requirements are translated by the lighting designer (or another designer) into a technical solution, for example, by using lighting simulations and analysis as well as providing other technical documentation. This technical solution includes descriptions of control, lighting principles, ambient light, and products, such as light fixtures. The products are described by the product supplier using standardized properties defined in a data dictionary. This information is accessed through a URI. The light fixture, Notor 65 Beta opti is used as a case study based on what was developed in the Map4Light project.
The products chosen by the lighting design can also be seen as a basis for requirements. This is done by defining certain properties as critical or key properties. The contractor uses these requirements (key properties) to propose a final product selection. If the final product selection differs from the lighting designer's choice, a new verification is carried out, for example, through light simulation, to ensure that the finally selected products meet the requirements described in the program. This verification occurs in consultation with the client.
An information structure with requirements and final product selections is handed over to the client at the handover of the building. 

## Scope and objective of use case

### Scope
This use case covers the implementation of data templates in the process of selection of a light fixture from the Inception stage to handover stage.

### Objectives
-Ensure circularity. Being able to repurpose objects based on key properties.
-Interoperability across the value chain.
-Improved lighting simulation.

### Business need 
Provide stakeholders with a framework to optimize selection of products based on function.

### Short description
This use case delineates a systematic approach for the selection of appropriate lighting fixtures designed to meet specific spatial lighting requirements. It encompasses the inception, design brief and design phases, offering stakeholders the capability to choose products based on their functionality while also satisfying predefined key requirements. The employment of standardized data templates is intended to have machine-readable information and preserve data integrity throughout the entire value chain. Furthermore, the methodologies and data structures outlined in this use case are scalable to subsequent stages of operation and maintenance.
